# fashion_numpy

This is the code for my instagram post about using the keras.datasets fashion_mnist.
You will require you to download my repository named Numpy_Neural_Library to work.
In the imports of the program, the is a line that looks like what follows:

      import sys
      yourDirectory = 'path/to/library'
      
This will have to be changed to the directory that Numpy_Neural_Library is on
your computer. The program will tell you if you didn't install the repository, or entered the incorrect directory
